# URL-Redirection-Testing
URL Redirection is a vulnerability in which by providing the right parameter & value a bad actor can redirect the user request to any malicious website.I developed a tool to find out the URLs having the parameters that can be used for URL Redirection.

# Instructions for direct execution without python or any other dependency installed.
1. Download or Clone the repository.
2. Open the "exeFile" folder.
3. Enter the list of URLs containing parameters in to the file named "input.txt" in the format specified below.
4. Execute the "urlredirect.exe"
5. It will automatically create an ouptut.csv file containing the output.

Caution : Do not rename the input file or exe file.
